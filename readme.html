    Host this container somewhere and load it with query variable called 'config' which points at a url of json config to load.

    Config needs to be an array of {url, time, refresh} where url is the dash to load, time is integrer seconds it will be visible, and refresh is a boolean indicating whether it should be refreshed before showing.
